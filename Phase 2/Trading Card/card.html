      <p id="summary">A legendary creature with the body, tail, and back legs of a lion; the head and wings of an eagle; and an eagle's talons
        as its front feet. Because the lion was traditionally considered the king of the beasts and the eagle the king of
        birds, the griffin was thought to be an especially powerful and majestic creature.</p>
