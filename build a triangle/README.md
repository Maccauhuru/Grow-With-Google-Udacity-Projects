# Directions:

For this quiz, you're going to create a function called buildTriangle() that will accept an input (the triangle at its widest width)

and will return the string representation of a triangle. See the example output below.

buildTriangle(10);


## Returns:

## Further Directions

We've given you one function makeLine() to start with. The function takes in a line length, and builds a line of asterisks and returns the line with a newline character.

You will need to call this makeLine() function in buildTriangle().
