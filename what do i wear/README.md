# Directions:

Use the sizing chart above, create a series of logical expressions that prints the size of a t-shirt based on the measurements of shirtWidth, shirtLength, and shirtSleeve. Valid sizes include S, M, L, XL, 2XL, and 3XL.

For example, if...

var shirtWidth = 23; // size L (large)

var shirtLength = 30; // size L (large)

var shirtSleeve = 8.71; // size L (large)

Then print L to the console.

##Hint:

 You will need to compare a range of values when checking for shirtWidth, shirtLength, and shirtSleeve. For example, if the shirt's width is at least 20", but no more than 22", then the t-shirt should be medium (M) â€” as long as the other values for the shirt's length and sleeve measurements match up.
